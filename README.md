# TaaClient

This is an small service that runs on a Taal customer's machine and interacts with Taal's API.

All private keys used for signing customer's transactions are only held on the customer's machine.

Binaries for Linux, Mac and Windows can be found at https://cdn.taal.com.

## Console

When starting TaalClient from the command line a console application will be started on `http://localhost:9500`. It gives easy access to all the functions of TaaClient.

## Direct Usage

TaalClient Starts listening for http requests on port 9500. This value can be changed via the console (https://localhost:9500/settings) or in the settings.conf file. If the changes are done through the settings file then TaalClient has to be restarted in order that the changes take effect.
All requests will be sent to https://api.taal.com by default unless overridden via the console (https://localhost:9500/settings) or in the settings.conf file.

## Database

By default, TaalClient creates a local database with the filename `taal_client.db` where api keys with public-private key pairs and transaction information are stored. Instead of a local DB it is possible to connect TaalClient to a postgres DB. This database mode has to be changed in the `Settings` page from `local` to `remote`. The same change can be done by the setting `dbType` from `sqlite` to `postgres` in the file `settings.conf`. The hostname, port, user, db name, and password have to be configured accordingly either through the console under `Settings` or directly settings file.

## Functions

### Registration

Before this client can be used, a valid Taal APIKey needs to be registered in order to bind it with a public key.

1. Register at https://console.taal.com
2. Obtain a TaalClient plan which best suits your needs
3. Make sure the TaalClient is running
4. Register the APIKey issued with the plan in TaalClient via the Key-Manager page which can be found at http://localhost:9500/key-manager

This key is stored in the database with the public-private key pair. When creating transactions the key pair never leaves the machine

### Writing data

After starting the TaalClient with ```taal-client``` you can then write data to the blockchain using the drag and drop interface (http://localhost:9500) or by POSTing directly to the TaalClient API.

```c
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:9500/api/v1/transactions' \
--header 'X-Tag: AN_OPTIONAL_TAG' \
--header 'X-Mode: <raw|hash|encrypt>' \
--header 'X-Key: A_SHARED_SECRET_KEY' \  
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <APIKey>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": "value2"
}'
```
The header `X-Key` is only needed in mode `encrypt`

A file can be POSTed by using the --data-binary flag:

```c
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:9500/api/v1/transactions' \
--header 'X-Mode: raw' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <APIKey>' \
--header 'Content-Type: image/png' \
--data-binary @myimage.png
```
The following diagram shows the different steps that happen when writing data

#### Modes

Currently data can be submitted in 3 different modes
1. Raw: The full data is submitted to the blockchain as raw data.
2. Hash: A SHA256 hash is created of the input data. Only this hash is submitted. Transactions submitted in this mode are deoned by a `#` symbol.
3. Encrypt: Data is encrypted by the given secret using AES encryption. The secret is stored in the local database. When downloading the data, the stored secret used for decryption. Transactions with encrypted data is denoted by a key symbol.

### Reading data

You can read data from the blockchain by GETing from the TaalClient.

```c
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:9500/api/v1/transactions/<txid>' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <APIKey>'
```

### Transaction history

Information about transactions which have been made through TaalClient are stored in a local database. This information includes ID, data size and timestamp. The history of all these transactions can be viewed on the `History` page of the console or by sending a request against the application e.g. using a curl command.

```c
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:9500/api/v1/transactions/?hours_back=24'
```

If the `hours_back` parameter is not set then all the whole transaction history will be returned.


## Before usage (MacOS / Linux version)
Before running the `taal-client` binary, make sure it is executable by running

```
chmod 755 taal-client
```

### MacOS

For the Mac version the code is not signed with a certificate issued by Apple currently. Therefore when running for the first time the following message will be shown.

![Mac1](https://github.com/TAAL-GmbH/taal-client/blob/master/assets/mac1.png)

In order to still run the application on a please open `Security & Privacy` settings and click on `Open Anyway` as shown in the following picture.

![Mac2](https://github.com/TAAL-GmbH/taal-client/blob/master/assets/mac2.png)

After that when running the application the following message will be shown. This time it has an `Open` button. Press this button in order to run the application.
