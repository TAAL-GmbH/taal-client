# taal-client

This is an small service that runs on a Taal customer's machine and interacts with Taal's API.

All private keys used for signing customer's transactions are only held on the customer's machine.

Binaries for Linux, Mac and Windows can be found at https://taal-gmbh.github.io.


## Direct Usage

## Writing data

After starting the TaalClient with ```taal-client``` you can then write data to the blockchain using the drag and drop interface (http://localhost:9500) or by POSTing directly to the TaalClient API.

```c
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:9500/api/v1/write' \
--header 'X-Tag: AN_OPTIONAL_TAG' \
--header 'X-Mode: <raw|hash|encrypt>' \
--header 'X-Key: A_SHARED_SECRET_KEY' \  
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <APIKey>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": "value2"
}'
```

or to POST a file, use the --data-binary flag:

```
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:9500/api/v1/write' \
--header 'X-Mode: raw' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <APIKey>' \
--header 'Content-Type: image/png' \
--data-binary @myimage.png
```

### Modes
Currently data can be submitted in 3 different modes
1. Raw: The full data is submitted to the blockchain as raw data.
2. Hash: A SHA256 hash is created of the input data. Only this hash is submitted.
3. Encrypt: Data is encrypted by the given secret using AES encryption. The secret is stored in the local database. When downloading the data, the stored secret used for decryption. Transactions with encrypted data is denoted by a key symbol.

## Reading data

After starting the TaalClient with ```taal-client``` you can then read data from the blockchain by GETing from the TaalClient.

```c
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:9500/api/v1/read/<txid>' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <APIKey>'
```

## Before usage
